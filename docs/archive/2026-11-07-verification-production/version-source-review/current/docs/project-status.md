# SpecForge Project Status

> **Role**: the single current execution-status entry for SpecForge development.
>
> **Not product authority**: product requirements and architecture remain owned by the Product Specification and Authority Registry.
>
> **History boundary**: this file contains only the current resumable checkpoint. Historical plans, reports, handoffs, and evidence belong in Git or `docs/archive/`.

NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION=Read live original authoritative state and monitor0257; reuse all real implementation/formal successes and keep five pre-start schema refusals. Finish remaining formal receipts and actual Report/Evidence/Gates/FV/Close through installed owners. Driver observation window ends about06:32Z; if still active, stop only at evidenced legal boundary, preserve children/attempts and resume a new minimum-context session from actual state, not hardcoded implementation_running. Do not replace current native assets while original receipts are active. Complete exact-scope raw/blob review and commit1.0.23 metadata/status/ledger, then after original legal completion/stop rebuild/precheck/install/test current native package. Complete SPS matrix and direct-main product Git delivery. Business-main merge requires separate concrete can_merge=true plan and user confirmation.

## Resume guidance

Run the read-only bootstrap before relying on this file:

```text
node scripts/project-session-bootstrap.mjs
```

Resume only from `NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION` after reviewing live Git facts and any worktree changes reported by the bootstrap. Execution mode, run id, evidence root and stop points are validated by the bootstrap under PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA=2.
