# Round 7 Audit Report: P0-1 not_enabled + P0-2 quick_change closure + precise-missing verification + production entry point fix

## Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/workflow-runtime/src/WorkflowEngine.ts` | `determineNextState`: removed `isWaivable`, changed `gateOk = gateResult.passed === true` |
| `packages/workflow-runtime/src/engine/WorkflowEngine.ts` | Same fix in engine/ copy |
| `packages/workflow-runtime/tests/unit/evidence-guard-v11.test.ts` | +29 tests: NE-1~NE-7 (not_enabled), QC-1~QC-7 (quick_change closure), PM-1~PM-5d + PM-pos-1~5 (precise-missing) |
| `packages/daemon-core/src/tools/handlers/sf-state-transition.ts` | **Production entry point fix**: compute `workItemDir` from projectPath, pass to `transitionFull`, wrap in try-catch to prevent StateManager on failure |
| `packages/daemon-core/tests/unit/sf-state-transition.test.ts` | +9 tests: ST-EV-1~9 (workItemDir propagation, evidence guard integration, StateManager isolation) |

## Test Results

- `evidence-guard-v11.test.ts`: **107/107 passed**
- `sf-state-transition.test.ts`: **12/12 passed** (3 original + 9 new)
- `WorkflowEngine.test.ts + engine.test.ts`: **65/66 passed** (1 pre-existing timeout: `should handle async event handlers`)
- TypeScript compilation: **0 errors**

| `merge_report.md` (status=not_applicable) | `merge_not_applicable` (quick_change) | `merge_runner` agent | `closed` — **NOT checked** by enforceTransitionEvidence | Not checked by runtime. Checked by `close_gate` composite gate (if configured) | At `close_gate` evaluation |

| `gate_summary.md` | `gates_running` | gate_runner (infrastructure) | `approval_required` | `enforceTransitionEvidence('approval_required')` via `requireFileWithStatus()` | Before entering `approval_required` |

**Key design decisions**:

1. **state.produces is declarative** — defined in workflow JSON configs (e.g., `quick_change.json`), not enforced by the runtime engine itself. The runtime only checks CRITICAL_STATES via `enforceTransitionEvidence()`.
2. **Runtime checks at transition boundaries** — `enforceTransitionEvidence()` is called by `transitionFull()` before allowing entry into any CRITICAL_STATE. It checks file existence + gate JSON status.
3. **Gate checks are separate from file checks** — `executeSimpleGate` / `executeCompositeGate` run the actual gate logic (checkFn). `enforceTransitionEvidence` is a separate pre-flight check that verifies artifacts exist before the transition is even attempted.
4. **`merge_report.md` is NOT checked by enforceTransitionEvidence** — it is produced by `merge_not_applicable` but not verified at any CRITICAL_STATE boundary. It is a logging artifact, not a gate prerequisite.
5. **Non-CRITICAL states don't get evidence checks** — `decision_recorded`, `merge_not_applicable`, `implementation_running`, etc. have no `enforceTransitionEvidence` requirements. Their artifacts are assumed correct if the gate infrastructure produced them.

## Section: approval_required — human-in-the-loop breakpoint

### Definition

`approval_required` is a **human-in-the-loop breakpoint** in the v1.1 state machine. It is NOT a pass/fail gate state.

### Semantics

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Gate type | `null` (no gate checkFn) |
| Pass/fail | Not applicable — approval is a user decision, not a gate result |
| Branches | `approved` → `decision_recorded` (quick_change) or `merge_ready` (feature_spec); `rejected` → terminal |
| Who advances | `User Decision Recorder` agent OR external `transitionFull()` call |
| Can `execute()` auto-advance? | **No** — `approval_required` has `gate: null`, which means `determineNextState` returns the state itself (no gate to evaluate), causing execute() to terminate |

### Why execute() stops here

```typescript
// In determineNextState():
if (!stateDef.gate) {
  // No gate → stay in current state (terminal for execute())
  return state; // returns 'approval_required'
}
```

Since `approval_required` has `gate: null`, `execute()` will set `currentState = 'approval_required'` and stop. No automatic advancement occurs.

### How it advances

1. **User Decision Recorder** agent writes `user_decision.json` with `decision_status: 'approved'` or `'rejected'`, then calls `transitionFull({ toState: 'decision_recorded' })` or `transitionFull({ toState: 'rejected' })`.
2. **External caller** (daemon-core, orchestrator) calls `transitionFull({ toState: 'merge_ready' })` after verifying `user_decision.json` exists with approved status.

### Test coverage

- `evidence-guard-v11.test.ts` S3: `transitionFull()` without workItemDir blocks approval_required
- `evidence-guard-v11.test.ts` S10-16: empty dir blocks approval_required
- `evidence-guard-v11.test.ts` NE-4: gate_summary_gate not_enabled → cannot reach approval_required (enters blocked)
- PM-1: missing user_decision.json blocks merge_ready (standard v11 path)

## Table 6: Precise-missing evidence test matrix

Each test prepares ALL evidence for a target CRITICAL state except ONE specific item, proving the failure is caused by that single missing item.

## Section: Production entry point — sf_state_transition workItemDir fix (R1 resolution)

### Problem

`sf_state_transition` (the production state transition tool handler in daemon-core) was calling `transitionFull()` without `workItemDir`. This meant CRITICAL_STATES transitions through the production API would throw "workItemDir is required" instead of performing actual evidence checks.

This was the **R1 risk item** identified in the pre-merge audit: `sf-state-transition.ts` could bypass evidence guards by calling `StateManager.transition()` directly.

### Fix

1. **Compute `workItemDir`** from `projectPath` + `SPEC_DIR_NAME` + `'work-items'` + `workItemId`:
   ```
   {projectRoot}/.specforge/work-items/{workItemId}
   ```
2. **Pass `workItemDir` to `transitionFull()`** — this activates `enforceTransitionEvidence` for CRITICAL_STATES.
3. **Wrap `transitionFull()` in try-catch** — if it throws, return `{ success: false, error }` without calling `StateManager.transition()`.
4. **`StateManager.transition()` only executes after `transitionFull()` succeeds** — it is a pure persistence layer, not an independent state transition entry point.

### Architecture

```
sf_state_transition handler
  ├─ transitionFull(workItemDir)  ← evidence guard checked HERE
  │   └─ enforceTransitionEvidence() → throws if evidence missing
  └─ StateManager.transition()   ← only reached if transitionFull succeeds
```

### Tests (ST-EV-1~9)

| ID | Scenario | Engine | Evidence prepared | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ST-EV-1 | workItemDir passed for approval_required | Mock | N/A | workItemDir contains `.specforge/work-items/WI-001` | PASS |
| ST-EV-2 | workItemDir passed for implementation_ready | Mock | N/A | workItemDir contains `.specforge/work-items/WI-002` | PASS |
| ST-EV-3 | transitionFull throws → StateManager NOT called | Mock (throws) | N/A | success=false, StateManager uncalled | PASS |
| ST-EV-4 | success path calls both | Mock | N/A | success=true, both called | PASS |
| ST-EV-5 | no projectPath → workItemDir=undefined | Mock | N/A | success=false (projectPath required) | PASS |
| ST-EV-6 | Real engine: missing gate blocks approval_required | Real | WI dir (no gate files) | success=false, StateManager uncalled | PASS |
| ST-EV-7 | Real engine: gate evidence present → approval_required | Real | gate_summary.md + gate_summary_gate.json(passed) | success=true, StateManager called | PASS |
| ST-EV-8 | Real engine: missing code_permission_release_gate → implementation_ready blocked | Real | tasks.md + work_item.json (no gate) | success=false, StateManager uncalled | PASS |
| ST-EV-9 | Real engine: all evidence → implementation_ready | Real | tasks.md + work_item.json + gate(passed) | success=true, StateManager called | PASS |

**12/12 sf-state-transition tests pass (3 original + 9 new).**

### R1 Status Update

| Item | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| R1: sf-state-transition bypasses evidence guard | **Medium risk** — no workItemDir | **Fixed** — workItemDir computed and passed; StateManager isolated |
| StateManager.transition role | Potential independent entry point | **Confirmed as persistence-only** — only called after transitionFull succeeds |
