# SpecForge Project Status

> **Role**: the single current execution-status entry for SpecForge development.
>
> **Not product authority**: product requirements and architecture remain owned by the Product Specification and Authority Registry.
>
> **History boundary**: this file contains only the current resumable checkpoint. Historical plans, reports, handoffs, and evidence belong in Git or `docs/archive/`.

PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA=1
PROJECT_STATUS_DECLARATION=ACTIVE
ACTIVE_INITIATIVE=CG013_PERMISSION_WRITE_GUARD_ENFORCEMENT_CONVERGENCE
OBJECTIVE=Converge distributed Permission and Write Guard enforcement onto one explicit decision and enforcement boundary without weakening current authorization or audit behavior.
CURRENT_PHASE=CG013_DAEMON_DECISION_ENFORCEMENT_BOUNDARY_CONVERGENCE
OWNER_DECISIONS=AR-DEC-01:APPROVED;AR-DEC-02:APPROVED_WITH_ARCHIVE_CONSOLIDATION;AR-DEC-03:APPROVED_WITH_KIRO_RETIREMENT;AR-DEC-04:APPROVED_WITH_SINGLE_PROJECT_STATUS;D05:OPENCODE_ADAPTER_ENABLED
LAST_COMPLETED_CHECKPOINT=CG013 first slice removed the unconsumed Workflow Runtime WriteGuard, CodePermissionService, and ChangedFilesAudit implementation, its two test-only consumers, and its legacy v11 barrel export; a Scope Gate boundary test now preserves Daemon ownership of current write decisions and enforcement; Workflow Runtime 69 files/1516 tests, Daemon 198 files/1743 tests, and Scope Gate 28 files/125 tests pass with all three package builds green.
CURRENT_BLOCKER=NONE
NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION=Compare Daemon checkWrite/evaluatePolicy and HTTP/shell prechecks against Permission Engine decisions, identify the first behaviorally equivalent duplicated decision path with direct characterization tests, and converge it without weakening fail-closed enforcement or changing product authorization policy.

## Resume guidance

Run the read-only bootstrap before relying on this file:

```text
node scripts/project-session-bootstrap.mjs
```

Resume only from `NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION` after reviewing live Git facts and any worktree changes reported by the bootstrap.
