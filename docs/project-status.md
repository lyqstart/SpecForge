<!-- SPECFORGE_PROJECT_STATUS:START -->
PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA=1
PROJECT_STATUS_DECLARATION=ACTIVE
ACTIVE_INITIATIVE=CG009_LEGACY_CLI_DISTRIBUTION_CONVERGENCE
OBJECTIVE=Remove the active npm-global, specforge init, and user-home ~/.specforge deployment contract from current CLI consumers while preserving only explicitly authorized legacy read/migration behavior.
CURRENT_PHASE=CG009_PUBLIC_RELEASE_ENTRY_CONVERGED_LEGACY_LIBRARY_AUDIT_PENDING
OWNER_DECISIONS=AR-DEC-01:APPROVED;AR-DEC-02:APPROVED_WITH_ARCHIVE_CONSOLIDATION;AR-DEC-03:APPROVED_WITH_KIRO_RETIREMENT;AR-DEC-04:APPROVED_WITH_SINGLE_PROJECT_STATUS;D05:OPENCODE_ADAPTER_ENABLED
LAST_COMPLETED_CHECKPOINT=Expected-red coverage now proves the release CLI does not expose specforge init or user-home deployment guidance; the init registration and help entries were removed, npm-global smoke runner code/tests were retired, and CLI build/full tests plus Scope Gate pass.
CURRENT_BLOCKER=NONE
NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION=Audit the now-unreachable CLI init/wizard, installation-record, daemon-healthcheck, path-resolver install-source branch, and their tests; retain only independently consumed build tooling or explicit read-only migration support, then remove the remaining retired deployment code.

## Resume guidance

Run the read-only bootstrap before relying on this file:

```text
node scripts/project-session-bootstrap.mjs
```

Resume only from `NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION` after reviewing live Git facts and any worktree changes reported by the bootstrap.
