# SpecForge Project Status

> **Role**: the single current execution-status entry for SpecForge development.
>
> **Not product authority**: product requirements and architecture remain owned by the Product Specification and Authority Registry.
>
> **History boundary**: this file contains only the current resumable checkpoint. Historical plans, reports, handoffs, and evidence belong in Git or `docs/archive/`.

EXECUTION_EVIDENCE_ROOT=D:/code/SpecForge/docs/archive/2026-11-03-original-wi-archive-restore
LAST_EXECUTION_CHECKPOINT=Controlled Recovery owner is implemented, tested, committed and deployed; installer verifies 112 files. First import rejected empty Git directories before writes; corrected and covered by 33 passing tests. Deployed retry restored all 319 sealed files with exact hashes, original commit 8a692e88c0823984647622294f5199c18bb0c587 in detached HEAD, and retained the full residual tree. Formal sf_state_read confirms the sole WI-0001=candidate_preparing and unchanged five-event history. First-load projection version 6 to 7 is recorded. Original native session has resumed toward Candidate approval; no approval or implementation is authorized.
NEXT_EXECUTION_STOP=AT_ORIGINAL_WI_CANDIDATE_APPROVAL_OR_PROVEN_ARCHIVE_RECOVERY_CAPABILITY_GAP
LAST_COMPLETED_CHECKPOINT=Incident reconstruction, deployed registration, native compaction checkpoint delivery, post-write checkpoint crash survival and bounded business-state WAL replay are independently evidenced. The latest isolated replay recovered two fixture Work Items after projection loss with identical event history and cursor. Session identity restoration is separate from Work Item authority. No original business WI recovery, complete workflow acceptance or overall SPS PASS claim has been made.
CURRENT_BLOCKER=NONE_DURING_OWNER_CANDIDATE_RECOVERY
NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION=Observe original native session ses_e8e849253ffeo8tI9ZIOUEjSZ5 and independently audit professional owner handoffs, Candidate seal, required Gates and formal state. Stop at real Candidate approval or a proven capability gap; preserve failures and do not infer approval from archive restoration.

## Resume guidance

Run the read-only bootstrap before relying on this file:

```text
node scripts/project-session-bootstrap.mjs
```

Resume only from `NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION` after reviewing live Git facts and any worktree changes reported by the bootstrap. Execution mode, run id, evidence root and stop points are validated by the bootstrap under PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA=2.
