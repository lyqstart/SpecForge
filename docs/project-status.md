# SpecForge Project Status

> **Role**: the single current execution-status entry for SpecForge development.
>
> **Not product authority**: product requirements and architecture remain owned by the Product Specification and Authority Registry.
>
> **History boundary**: this file contains only the current resumable checkpoint. Historical plans, reports, handoffs, and evidence belong in Git or `docs/archive/`.

PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA=1
PROJECT_STATUS_DECLARATION=ACTIVE
ACTIVE_INITIATIVE=CG013_PERMISSION_WRITE_GUARD_ENFORCEMENT_CONVERGENCE
OBJECTIVE=Converge distributed Permission and Write Guard enforcement onto one explicit decision and enforcement boundary without weakening current authorization or audit behavior.
CURRENT_PHASE=CG013_SHELL_RUNTIME_RULE_CONVERGENCE
OWNER_DECISIONS=AR-DEC-01:APPROVED;AR-DEC-02:APPROVED_WITH_ARCHIVE_CONSOLIDATION;AR-DEC-03:APPROVED_WITH_KIRO_RETIREMENT;AR-DEC-04:APPROVED_WITH_SINGLE_PROJECT_STATUS;D05:OPENCODE_ADAPTER_ENABLED
LAST_COMPLETED_CHECKPOINT=CG013 sixth slice moved HTTP Work Item artifact direct-write rejection into the canonical Permission Engine decision. HTTP direct and expected-file checks now use checkWrite; raw shell command detection reuses the same canonical helper; denied direct writes reach the Write Guard audit instead of returning before logging. Permission Engine 21 files/372 tests, Daemon 199 files/1730 tests, and Scope Gate 28 files/127 tests pass; Permission Engine, Daemon, and Scope Gate builds pass; the formal release precheck passes.
CURRENT_BLOCKER=NONE
NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION=Characterize and converge the remaining shell runtime authorization branches outside decideWritePermission: implementation_running state enforcement and directory-preparation allowance; preserve target parsing, dangerous-command safety, HardStop, scoped authorization validation, and audit as Daemon enforcement responsibilities. Then characterize the non-write tool.invoking record-only and timeout-default-allow path separately.

## Resume guidance

Run the read-only bootstrap before relying on this file:

```text
node scripts/project-session-bootstrap.mjs
```

Resume only from `NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION` after reviewing live Git facts and any worktree changes reported by the bootstrap.
