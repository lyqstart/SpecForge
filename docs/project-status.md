# SpecForge Project Status

> **Role**: the single current execution-status entry for SpecForge development.
>
> **Not product authority**: product requirements and architecture remain owned by the Product Specification and Authority Registry.
>
> **History boundary**: this file contains only the current resumable checkpoint. Historical plans, reports, handoffs, and evidence belong in Git or `docs/archive/`.

PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA=1
PROJECT_STATUS_DECLARATION=ACTIVE
ACTIVE_INITIATIVE=AUTHORITY_MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION_CONVERGENCE
OBJECTIVE=Confirm that every SPS-1.0 conformance gap is closed and identify any remaining current-release mismatch before authorizing another implementation initiative.
CURRENT_PHASE=SPS_CONFORMANCE_GAP_CLOSURE_AUDIT
OWNER_DECISIONS=AR-DEC-01:APPROVED;AR-DEC-02:APPROVED_WITH_ARCHIVE_CONSOLIDATION;AR-DEC-03:APPROVED_WITH_KIRO_RETIREMENT;AR-DEC-04:APPROVED_WITH_SINGLE_PROJECT_STATUS;D05:OPENCODE_ADAPTER_ENABLED
LAST_COMPLETED_CHECKPOINT=CG013 final slice retired the producerless bare tool.invoking Phase 1 record-only pseudo-authorization route and its HTTP PermissionEngine injection surface. Current Plugin opencode.tool.invoking events remain observability-only through SessionRegistry; write authorization continues through the canonical Permission Engine decision and Daemon enforcement boundary. Targeted Daemon tests (39), Daemon full regression (199 files/1731 tests), Scope Gate boundary tests (4), and Scope Gate full regression (28 files/127 tests) pass; Daemon and Scope Gate builds pass; formal release precheck passes for candidate main-44df0693-working-tree-stepcg013toolingest.
CURRENT_BLOCKER=NONE
NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION=Perform a read-only SPS conformance-gap audit and report any remaining current-release mismatch before proposing a new implementation initiative.

## Resume guidance

Run the read-only bootstrap before relying on this file:

```text
node scripts/project-session-bootstrap.mjs
```

Resume only from `NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION` after reviewing live Git facts and any worktree changes reported by the bootstrap.
