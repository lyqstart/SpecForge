# SpecForge Project Status

> **Role**: the single current execution-status entry for SpecForge development.
>
> **Not product authority**: product requirements and architecture remain owned by the Product Specification and Authority Registry.
>
> **History boundary**: this file contains only the current resumable checkpoint. Historical plans, reports, handoffs, and evidence belong in Git or `docs/archive/`.

PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA=1
PROJECT_STATUS_DECLARATION=ACTIVE
ACTIVE_INITIATIVE=CG013_PERMISSION_WRITE_GUARD_ENFORCEMENT_CONVERGENCE
OBJECTIVE=Converge distributed Permission and Write Guard enforcement onto one explicit decision and enforcement boundary without weakening current authorization or audit behavior.
CURRENT_PHASE=CG013_NON_WRITE_TOOL_PERMISSION_CHARACTERIZATION
OWNER_DECISIONS=AR-DEC-01:APPROVED;AR-DEC-02:APPROVED_WITH_ARCHIVE_CONSOLIDATION;AR-DEC-03:APPROVED_WITH_KIRO_RETIREMENT;AR-DEC-04:APPROVED_WITH_SINGLE_PROJECT_STATUS;D05:OPENCODE_ADAPTER_ENABLED
LAST_COMPLETED_CHECKPOINT=CG013 seventh slice moved shell implementation_running, permission-revoked, and explicit directory-preparation authorization into the canonical Permission Engine decision. Daemon supplies authoritative state, classifies only explicit New-Item -ItemType Directory targets, and retains enforcement, dangerous-command safety, HardStop, scoped authorization validation, and audit. Normal file create cannot borrow directory ancestor allowance. Permission Engine 21 files/375 tests, Daemon 199 files/1733 tests, and Scope Gate 28 files/127 tests pass; Permission Engine, Daemon, and Scope Gate builds pass; the formal release precheck passes.
CURRENT_BLOCKER=NONE
NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION=Characterize the remaining non-write tool.invoking record-only and timeout-default-allow path against the SPS Permission boundary; distinguish observability-only events from authorization decisions before proposing any implementation change.

## Resume guidance

Run the read-only bootstrap before relying on this file:

```text
node scripts/project-session-bootstrap.mjs
```

Resume only from `NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION` after reviewing live Git facts and any worktree changes reported by the bootstrap.
