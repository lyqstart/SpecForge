# SpecForge Project Status

> **Role**: the single current execution-status entry for SpecForge development.

> **Not product authority**: product requirements and architecture remain owned by the Product Specification and Authority Registry.

> **History boundary**: this file contains only the current resumable checkpoint. Historical plans, reports, handoffs, and evidence belong in Git or `docs/archive/`.

PROJECT_STATUS_SCHEMA=1
PROJECT_STATUS_DECLARATION=ACTIVE
ACTIVE_INITIATIVE=CG013_PERMISSION_WRITE_GUARD_ENFORCEMENT_CONVERGENCE
OBJECTIVE=Converge distributed Permission and Write Guard enforcement onto one explicit decision and enforcement boundary without weakening current authorization or audit behavior.
CURRENT_PHASE=CG013_PERMISSION_ENGINE_DECISION_CONTRACT_ANALYSIS
OWNER_DECISIONS=AR-DEC-01:APPROVED;AR-DEC-02:APPROVED_WITH_ARCHIVE_CONSOLIDATION;AR-DEC-03:APPROVED_WITH_KIRO_RETIREMENT;AR-DEC-04:APPROVED_WITH_SINGLE_PROJECT_STATUS;D05:OPENCODE_ADAPTER_ENABLED
LAST_COMPLETED_CHECKPOINT=CG013 second slice removed the unconsumed Daemon evaluatePolicy/default-rule duplicate, command-write-audit module, and write-policy compatibility barrel while retaining canonical checkWrite and the bash rule interface; Daemon 198 files/1743 tests and Scope Gate 28 files/126 tests pass, both package builds are green, and formal release precheck passes.
CURRENT_BLOCKER=NONE
NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION=Define and characterize the current canonical write-decision contract at the Permission Engine boundary, then connect one Daemon enforcement entry to that contract without changing existing checkWrite decisions, fail-closed behavior, audit output, or product authorization policy.

## Resume guidance

Run the read-only bootstrap before relying on this file:

```text
node scripts/project-session-bootstrap.mjs
```

Resume only from `NEXT_LEGAL_ACTION` after reviewing live Git facts and any worktree changes reported by the bootstrap.
